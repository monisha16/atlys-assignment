# Atlys Posts Feed

This project is a responsive React web application written in Javascript using Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Live Demo
[Demo Link](https://atlys-posts-feed.netlify.app/)


## Project Flow
1. The `demo link` lands at the login / register screen

2. All the registered users are stored in the `Local Storage` and the LoggedIn user is stored in the `Session Storage`

3. `/home` route takes you to the posts feed, where at the moment the posts are rendered through a dummy data list

4. If the user were to directly `jumpt onto` the `/home` route `without logging in`, They are `not allowed to submit a post` and the `Auth flow Modal` opens up
